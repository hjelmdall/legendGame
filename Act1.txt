You have finished a long voyage with your crew. Your ship draws close to the shoreline when the local coast guard abruptly halts your approach.He demands you to pay a hefty toll in order for you to dock. What would you like to do?

1) Attack his ship.
2) Look to see if there are other ports willing to let you dock without a fine.
3) Try to convince the coast guard to give you a discount.
4) Try to outrun him and reach get lost among the other ships at the dock.
5) Threaten to have the coast guard's position removed once you reach port.
#
You and your crew barely manage to get safely ashore after taking care of that coast guard thanks to  your excellent leadership and judgement.As you disembark your ship with your crew to deliver your plundered goods. A local bounty hunter confronts you, he demands he must bring you in to cash in your bounty. What do you do?

1) Give him a nice right hook!
2) Tell him you have the wrong man.
3) Give him some gold and ask him to pretend that he never saw you.
4) Take off, and lose him in the crowd.
5) Tell him to get lost, you answer to no one. 
#
With the bounty hunter behind you now, You walk into the local pub to meet your client Simon to collect your reward for the goods you've brought.He tells you he can't pay you everything right now and tells you that you need to cut ties with him due to your warrants. He explains that you are detrimental to his business and tells you that bad things will happen if you refuse.What do you do?

1) This is an outrage! Draw your dagger and demand him to fulfill his agreement.
2) You see your crewmate in the window behind Simon, signal him to take Simon's coin purse.
3) Arrange a new deal with Simon, one that can be favorable for both parties.
4) You consider his proposal thoughtfully, when you notice a pub waitress carrying two full trays of soup walks by your table. You plan to quickly
draw your foot out to trip her.She would trip and spill the piping hot soup on Simon's face. You would use this opportunity to grab his coin purse.
5) You threaten to have his business ruined. Your confident that your reputation with the local underworld will heed to your call as you undermine 
Simon's dealings with other smugglers.
#
You walk out triumphantly from the pub counting the fresh coins in your purse. You follow your crewmates through a dark alleyway nearby the pub to keep a low profile. Your crewmates start to outpace you as they walk quickly down the alleyway away from you. Curious, you beckon them to slow down until something hard strikes you on the back of your head rendering you unconscious. You awake hours later in a barred cell. All your belongings are stripped from. All you have is a worn tunic to wear and scraps of bones strewn across the floor being gnawed upon by rats. You're confused to why you have wound up here, when it occurs to you that your crew mates have betrayed you for your bounty. Swearing revenge, you look across the cell to look for clues that could lead you to your escape.You:

1) You wait until an unsuspecting guard comes close to strangle him until he's unconscious then grab his keys.
2) Use a bone to coax a prison dog to bring you the extra pair of keys that have fallen onto the floor just beyond the cell.
3) Convince the guard that you contracted an exotic form of smallpox and you must be relocated from your cell in order to not infect the other cell
mates.Then make your escape.
4) Play dead until the guard opens up your cell to check on you, then make a run for it.
5) Tell the guard that you stockpiled many riches on nearby islands and that he can share the wealth with you if he helps escape.
#
Sprung from jail, you hurry outside and tip toe your way past the prison guards. However, you are confronted by an entire garrison of troops guarding the entrance of the prison.You can't seem to find any other way out until you hear whispers. You look of your shoulder to see a beautiful woman wearing a guard's uniform. She beckons you to come follow her her to safety. You have just been double crossed twice. You're not sure if the woman can be trusted. What do you do?

1) Smile at the woman, then bolt for an open window just feet away from the garrison guards hoping the fall won't kill you.
2) You see no better ideas at the moment and decide to follow the mysterious woman.
3) You knock out a nearby guard to take his uniform. With your disguise you attempt to get past the guards as you act like one of them.
4) As you think, you see a priest accompanying his mule pulling his supply cart. You plan to grab a nearby torch to excite the mule with
flames.Terrified, the mule would take off hurriedly towards the crowd of troops stationed by the entrance. Alarmed, the troops duck for cover
as the mule and the cart slams through the doors. with the guards momentarily indisposed, you take your chances and sprint towards your freedom.
5) Having served in the town military before, you believe your commendations on the battlefield will yield you enough respect from the troops and let 
you go.
#
Your actions have bought you freedom! Outside on the prison grounds, you find a good place to hide from patrolling guards. You notice the mysterious woman in a hiding place not too far away from yours. You crawl over to her to ask why she is helping you. She tells you her name is Cassandra and that the loyal members of your crew has hired her expertise to rescue you. You thank her for the effort and tell her that they must get back to the ship to leave port.Keeping close to the city's alley ways.As you reach your ship, you tell your men to set sails, however, Cassandra has other plans. She alters her deal with your crew and now demands an equal share to your plunder that lies hidden on nearby islands along with the pay she was orignally promised. You:

1) Deny her deal of course! It's us against her, she has no heavy bargaining chip!
2) Accept her deal, let's just get the hell out of here....
# 
You decided to agree to Cassandra's terms. She did in fact try to help you escape despite the fact that you are very capable of handling yourself. Despite your reduced income, you and your crew sail far and wide plundering and trading riches until the end of your days. 
The END
#
You and crew erupt in laughter leaving Cassandra curiously unphased by your amusement. You thank her again for her trouble but there is no way you will split up your fortune to some stranger. You give her her payment your crew promised and show her way out to the dock.You depart shortly after and sail for a couple of hours before sunset. As you lay yourself to sleepy that night, you think about all the trouble that you went through back at the city until you hear a loud thud outside your cabin door.You go to answer only to met by no one.You go out to the main deck to investigate only to find Cassandra and the city guard arresting your crew. Surrounded, you wonder how long they'll keep you locked away but you already know that there's a possibility you will never see the light of day again.
The END
